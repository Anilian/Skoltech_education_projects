My task was to filter the dataset to train a large generative model for one specific task. The first problem we faced was to select from 1 billion photos those that had a description suitable for a particular task. For example, descriptions of logos, characters from Russian children's cartoons, or even nswf, i.e. objects that model should be able to generate on demand. Our task was to filter dataset data to generate text on an image. For this purpose, we prepared a script that, using the CRAFT model, selects photos with text and outputs their descriptions. We had to adjust the confidence parameter of the model to avoid displaying patterns similar to letters. After analysing the selected descriptions, we selected keywords and collected a special dataset having only images with text.
